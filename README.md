# Sound Level Monitoring
In this project, I used Arduino Uno and Sparkfun sound sensor to collect sound level (amplitude) and display warning via LED pins. The aim is to measure the sound noise level in classrooms and trigger warnings using LED.

## Setup
- Red LED pin connected to digital pin 8 and GND
- Red LED pin connected to digital pin 7 and GND
- Yellow LED pin connected to digital pin 6 and GND
- Sparkfun ENVELOPE pin connected to analog pin 0 (A0)
- Sparkfun VCC pin connected to 5v
- Sparkfun GND pin connected to GND
